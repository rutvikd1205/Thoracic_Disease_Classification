"\n\n# README for Chest X-ray Disease Detection Project\n\nThis project utilizes a curated subset of the ChestX-ray8 dataset, which contains 112,120 frontal-view chest X-ray images from 30,805 unique patients. The subset, consisting of approximately 5000 images, has been intelligently partitioned into three sets: a training set with around 3,300 images, a validation set containing 1,200 images, and a test set comprising 500 images.\n\nThe dataset has been annotated with text-mined labels for 14 common thoracic pathologies, and for the specific needs of this project, a meticulous selection process resulted in a subset with labels converted to binary format. In this representation, a label of '1' signifies the presence of a thorax disease, while '0' denotes the absence of any pathology.\n\nThe project also includes data visualization, correlation analysis, and validation and test data preparation steps. The ultimate goal is to train a deep learning model for accurate disease detection in chest X-ray images.\n\nFor access to the original ChestX-ray8 dataset, please refer to the official repository: https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC."
